# Lights-Out
The 'Lights Out' project was performed as part of the University of Texas Data Analytics Certificate. 

<br> Objective: analyze (using R) residential power usage to determine the duration of occupancy. 

<br> Resource: Data housed in AWS and extracted using the RMariaDB package (SQL).
<br>Datasets contained minute-by-minute power usage from December 2006 - November 2010 with the following attributes: 
<ul>
	<li>Date</li>
 	<li>Time</li>
	<li>Active Power</li>
	<li>Reactive Power</li>
 	<li>Intensity</li>
	<li>Voltage</li>
	<li>Sub-meter 1 (dishwasher, oven and microwave)</li>
 	<li>Sub-meter 2 (washing-machine, tumble-drier, refrigerator and light)</li>
	<li>Sub-meter 3 (electric water-heater and air-conditioner)</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
Valuable Tips and Tricks From Excercise: 
<ul>
	<li>dplyr package| bind_rows function -- combines muliple datasets together into 1 dataset. newDF <- bind_rows(df1, df2, df3)</li>

</ul>
