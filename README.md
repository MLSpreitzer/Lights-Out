# Lights-Out
The 'Lights Out' project was performed as part of the University of Texas Data Analytics Certificate. Our objective is to analyze (using R) residential power usage to determine the duration of occupancy. 

Data was pulled from AWS using RMariaDB (SQL)
<br>Datasets contained power useage from December 2006 - November 2010 with the following attributes: 
<br>Date
<br>Time
<br>Active Power
<br>Reactive Power
<br>Intensity
<br>Voltage
<br>Sub-meter 1 (dishwasher, oven and microwave) 
<br>Sub-meter 2 (washing-machine, tumble-drier, refrigerator and light)
<br>Sub-meter 3 (electric water-heater and air-conditioner)
